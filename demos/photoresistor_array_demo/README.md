###Semester
Fall 2013

###Model
This demo takes analog readings from several photoresitor voltage dividers.  These values are compared against
experimentally determined "threshold" values.  If any reading is below this threshold, this means the photoresistor
is above a black line.

###Hardware
* 6 2kOhm photoresistors
* 6 2kOhm resistors
* 3 LEDs
* 3 110Ohm resistors

###Pins
A0,A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6 for reading photoresistors

###Purpose
This circuit could be used in application for line following.  This demo is particulary educational,
demonstrating concepts of voltage dividers with variable resistors.
