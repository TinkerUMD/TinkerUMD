Servo DEMO
</h1>

###Semester
Fall 2013

###Description

This demo demonstrates the functioning of a servo. The rotation of the servo is controlled by two push buttons.
One push button rotates the servo counter clockwise and the other one rotates it clockwise. Holding the push button during
rotation will keep the servo from rotating until its released again. There is also an led and the brightness is controlled
by the angle of the servo.

###Hardware
* 1 servo 
* 1 Arduinos
* Breadboard
* 2 push buttons
* 1 LED
* 2 10kohm resistors(for push button)
* 1 1kohm resistor(for LED)

###Pins
5V
Gnd
Pin 2,4 -> Push Button Input
Pin 3   -> LED
Pin 11  -> Servo motor

###Purpose
To show how the servo can be controlled in different ways. The possible application of this circuit could be detecting
when the hovercraft hits the pedestal. Instead of push buttons, a bump switch can be used.
