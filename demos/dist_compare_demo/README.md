Distance Sensor Comparison Demo
</h1>

Semester
---
Fall 2013

Model
---
Arduino Uno

Hardware
---
* 1 Sharp IR Distance Sensors
* 1 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
* 8 LEDs
* 8 1kOhm resistors
* Meterstick (optional)

Pins
---
D2-D10 for output to LEDs
D12 ultrasonic echo pin
D13 ultrasonic trigger pin
A0 IR sensor input

Purpose
---
To demonstrate how distance sensors can be used to measure distances to an object. To show the differences between different types of distance sensors. The IR sensor is less consistent and is susceptible to ambient light. The ultrasonic sensor is more expensive and much noisier and must be averaged.
