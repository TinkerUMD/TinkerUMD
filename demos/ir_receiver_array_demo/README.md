IR Receiver Array Demo
==================
###Semester
Fall 2013

###Model
This demonstrates an array of 56kHz IR receivers that detect an 56kHz IR source.  The detection is visualized
through a passive LED display and through serial output.

###Hardware
* 7 LEDs
* 7 56kHz IR receivers
* 7 1kOhm resistors

###Pins
list of pins used and their purpose

###Purpose
This demonstrates a circuit that could be used to detect the beacon for navigation in the course.
It also demonstrates the concept of digital reading multiple sensors.
