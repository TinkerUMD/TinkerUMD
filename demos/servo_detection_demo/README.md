Servo DEMO
</h1>

###Semester
Fall 2013

###Description

This demo demonstrates the functioning of a servo and distance sensor. The
distance sensor is attached to the front servo and there is another servo behind
the front sevo. The front servo is contonously rotatation, but it stops if the distance
sensor detects something within a certain range. The back servo roates to the angle
of the front servo, if an object is detected

###Hardware
* 2 servos
* 1 Arduino
* Breadboard
* 1 LED
* 1 1kohm resistor(for LED)
* Distance sensor

###Pins
5V
Gnd
Pin 5,6 -> Servo motors
Analog Pin 0   -> Distance Sensor
Pin 9  -> LED

###Purpose
To show how objects can be detected with a distance sensor and how servos can be controlled using multiple
sensors.
