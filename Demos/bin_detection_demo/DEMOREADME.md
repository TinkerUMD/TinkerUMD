Bin Detection Demo
===================
Semester
---
Fall 2013

Model
---
Bin detection demo is a program for an Arduino Uno. 

Hardware
---
* 4 Sharp IR Distance Sensors
* 4 LEDs
* 4 220ohm resistors

Pins
---
AI0, AI1, AI2, AI3 as input for distance sensors
D2, D3, D4, D5 as output for LEDs

Purpose
---
The goal of this demo is to give an example of using distance sensors as an option to interact with the payload. The sensors determine the highest of the four bins and turns on a corresponding LED.
